# CSCI4300 Web Programming Final Project

## Liam Fennell, Matthew Jue, Wasay Syed, Nathan Castro

Objective:
Work in groups to design and build a full stack CRUD  (create, read, update and delete) application.  Work with your group to come up with a problem to solve and design the application to solve it.  Consider a unique way to search, sort or filter the subject components.  


Your implementation should include the following design/implementation elements:


Implementation:
Frontend:
single-page app (SPA) design
UI design mockup in Figma
React function components 
use of React state to update UI based on change in data.  
components styled using CSS
components identifiable by file name
reusable component design that follows separation of concerns 
implementation (components encapsulate logic,  HTML and CSS)
incorporate form components to add and update elements and users
** subject components include:
title
image (urls are sufficient; upload and storage of images is not required)
other descriptive data based on subject (ie description, price, â€¦)
implement user accounts
user components that include login credentials
incorporate form components to add users - signup
establish authentication sessions so that only authenticated users can perform add, update and delete of subject components.
unauthenticated users may view
implement conditional elements in UI so that only logged in users have the option to logout and unauthenticated users have the option to login/signup.  
passwords must not be stored in plain text
implement client-side routing to provide direct links to specific views of the application 
implement asynchronous methods on all database requests
** subject components refers to the subject matter of your project. ie. if you are providing an application that categorizes books then book is the subject component. 

(Sample design with a header and 3 subject components.)


Backend:
use MongoDB to persist data.  MongoDB Atlas cloud implementation is suggested.
use of models to represent database elements
establish endpoints for each of the CRUD and user account operations 
appropriate error messages for invalid client-side routes, invalid login credentials  


Submission Components


video demonstration of all implemented functionality.  The video should be a comprehensive demonstration of all required functionality plus any additional design/functional elements. 


design document 
cover page listing group members and class section, 
UI design mockup 
list of custom components
description of database models
diagram of implemented routes (client side to server endpoints)
narrative of accomplishments, challenges, obstacles overcome, and any future direction with the project


source code - zipped project source code








Project Milestones


User Interface design - a color diagram detailing the planned design for the app.  Create the design in Figma.


Functioning User Interface.  Working front end only.  


Group member contribution and participation survey.  Every student will fill out and submit a survey rating the participation and contribution of group members.


Submit project zip, design document and video demonstration of all functional components and achieved objectives of the assignment.  All required functionality must be demonstrated in the demo video to receive credit. 


Class Demonstration - all group members must be present and participate
